# TodoList-Django
This is a todo list web application built using Django framework. Implemented using Python language with some CSS and HTML.

This project is implemented loosely following the tutorial "How To Build A TodoApp With Django" linked below. I made multiple
changes to the tutorial in order to create my own web application and make it a little easier to use in my opinion.
